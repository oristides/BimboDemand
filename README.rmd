# BimboDemand
Exploring some features of [Bimbo Kaggle Contest](https://www.kaggle.com/c/grupo-bimbo-inventory-demand)

In this repo we are going to try to explore more about the Bimbo data." It is very Big" To get some ideas where to start using some spatial analysis.

Firstly we clean up a little bit with stringr packages, geocode using the Google API for geocode Bimbo and then make a map to view some Mexican fenomenas. 

As we can see, as obvious, there are more agencies where there are more population.

Note: Therer are 44 missing vaalues (update 06/13/2016)
