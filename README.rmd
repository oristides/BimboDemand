# BimboDemand
Exploring some features of [Bimbo Kaggle Contest](https://www.kaggle.com/c/grupo-bimbo-inventory-demand)

In this repo we are going to try to explore more about the Bimbo data." It is very Big" To get some ideas where to start using ome spatial analysis
Firstly we clean up a little bit the map using the Google API for geocode Bimbo and then make a map to view some Mexican fenomenas.

As we can see, as obvious, there are more agencies where there are more population.
